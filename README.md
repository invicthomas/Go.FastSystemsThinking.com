### Speed, Strength and their Realationship to Force and Power
> Linemen need strength yes, but they also need to work on speed techniques and remember by working speed, this will help increase our rate of force and power. The same goes for the skilled positions as well; yes, they need to be fast, but by increasing their strength you will also increase their speed.Think about it this way, Powerlifters and Olympic Sprinters do not make the best football players. There needs to be a medium point when it comes to training for football.

### Practice, Practice, Practice
> Why are martial artists not muscular? MMA fighters are skinny because their training primarily focuses on high-repetition workouts. For example, fighters do 100 pushups rather than bench press 400 lbs. High-repetition workouts do not lead to big growth in muscles, but it keeps fighters resistant to muscle fatigue.

### Retzev - “Continuous Motion”
Retzev is a concept that urges the Krav Maga practitioner to utilize and harness the natural power in movement throughout both defensive and offensive initiatives within a self-defense technique(s).

### Optimum Speed is an Advantage. Strive to Develop Agility and Quickness.
> A powerful athlete is not a strong athlete, but one who can exert his strength quickly. Since power equals force times speed, if the athlete learns to make faster movements he increases his power, even though the contractile pulling strength of his muscles remains unchanged.Thus, a smaller man who can swing faster may hit as hard or as far as the heavier man who swings slowly.
[Bruce Lee](https://sourcesofinsight.com/bruce-lee-quotes/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20powerful%20athlete%20is%20not,of%20his%20muscles%20remains%20unchanged.)

### Anything worth doing is Hard!
As Pittsburgh Steeler hall of famer [Iron Mike Webster](https://www.steelers.com/history/bios/webster_mike) said at his hall of fame acceptance speech.

> Do not be afraid to fail. You're going to fail, believe me. No one's keeping score. All we have to do is finish the game. Then we'll all be winners.
